# BayesianDiscovery.jl

A package for a Bayesian approach to discover nonlinear dyanamic equations from ``A Bayesian Approach for Spatio-Temporal Data-Driven Dynamic Equation Discovery'', which can be found at https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2209.02750.
To install the package, clone the repository from GitHub and place it in your `/.julia/dev/` folder, navigate to the folder, and run
